## introduction

**spartan2** is a collection of data mining algorithms on **big graphs** and
**time series**, providing *three* basic tasks: ***anomaly detection***,
***forecast***, and ***summarization***. (see [readthedocs](https://spartan2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), and [tutorials](https://github.com/BGT-M/spartan2-tutorials) )

Graphs and time series are fundamental representations of many key applications
in a wide range of users' online behaviors (e.g. social media, shopping, Apps),
finance (e.g. stock tradings, bank transfers), IoT networks (e.g. sensor readings, smart power grid),
and healthcare (e.g. electrocardiogram, photoplethysmogram, respiratory inductance plethysmography).
In practice, we find that thinking graphs and time series as matrices or tensors
can enable us to find *efficient (near linear)*, *interpretable*, yet *accurate* solutions in many applications.

Therefore, our **goal** is developping a collectioin of algorithms on graphs and time series based
on **tensors** (matrix is a 2-mode tensor).

In real world, those tensors are *sparse*, and we
are required to make use of the sparsity to develop efficient algorithms. That is why
we name the backend package and a private UI interface as

**SparTAn**: **Spar**se **T**ensor **An**alytics.

spartan2 is the backend name. The package named **spartan** can be imported and run independently as a *usual python package*.
Everything in package **spartan** is viewed as a tensor (sparse).

## install requirements

This project requires Python 3.7 and upper.
We suggest recreating the experimental environment using Anaconda through the following steps.

1. Install the appropriate version for Anaconda from here - https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/

2. Create a new conda environment named "spartan"
```bash
conda create -n spartan python=3.7
conda activate spartan
```

3. If you are a normal **USER**,
<details><summary>download the package from pip</summary>

```bash
pip install spartan2
```

</details>


4. If you are a **DEVELOPER** and **contribute** to the project, or prefer to run directly on the code,
<details>
    <summary>please do the following setup</summary>

4.1 Clone the project from github

```bash
git clone <this repository link>/spartan2.git
```

4.2 Install requirements.
```bash
# [not recommended]# pip install --user --requirement requirements
# using conda tool
conda install --force-reinstall -y --name spartan -c conda-forge --file requirements
```

*or use the following way*

```bash
# this may not work in ubuntu 18.04
python setup.py install
```

4.3 Install code in development mode
```bash
# in parent directory of spartan2
pip install -e spartan2
```
4.4 Since you install your package to a location other than the user site-packages directory, you will need to
add environment variable PYTHONPATH in ~/.bashrc

```bash
export PYTHONPATH=/<dir to spartan2>/spartan2:$PYTHONPATH
```

*or prepend the path to that directory to your PYTHONPATH environment variable.*

```python
import sys
sys.path.append("/<dir to spartan2>/spartan2")
```
*or do as follows*

```bash
#find directory of site-packages
python -c 'import site; print(site.getsitepackages())'

#add \<name\>.pth file in your site-packages directory with string '/<dir to spartan2>/spartan2'

```

</details>


5. start jupyter notebook, and try live tutorials for demos:
<details><summary><strong>live-tutorials</strong></summary>
